  As technology of computer animation and robotics advances,
  controlling highly dynamic motions
  has been great milestones for both virtual and real humanoid characters.
  However, developing controllers for dynamic motor skills is yet a challenging
  problem which usually requires substantial amount of design efforts and
  optimization time due to its complexity.
  In this dissertation, we introduce a set of techniques to expedite
  the optimization process of dynamic controllers for various dynamic motor 
  skills, such as jumping, rolling, vaulting, and landing.

  First, we develop an online algorithm to control falling and landing motions 
  from a wide range of heights and initial speeds,
  which is an essential motor skill to ensure the safety of human and robots.
  We demonstrate that simple momentum planning with the proxy model of inertia 
  and feedback-based rules can generate the natural landing motions
  without large stresses on the joints.
  Further, we propose an optimization algorithm for multi-contact falling
  motions of a real robot for minimizing the damage and protecting the 
  important body parts.
  Unlikely the existing techniques which usually consider the contacts as
  invariant features, we searches over a sequence of contacts to find
  the best falling motion.

  We also show that the sampling-based optimization of dynamic controllers
  can be accelerated by our new technique,
  Covariance Matrix Adaptation with Classification (CMA-C), 
  which utilizes failed simulations to approximate an infeasible region.
  In additition, we introduce a new fast optimization algorithm 
  for solving a parameterized objective function.
  Inspired by Schmidt's Variability Practice Hypothesis, 
  our algorithm simultaneously solves a continuous set of optimizers 
  for parameterized motions at the interactive rate 
  by sharing the simulation samples across the parameterized goals.

  By incorporating the propose techniques, we can produce highly-dynamic motions 
  of virtual characters and real robots with the short computation time.

  %% controllers for virtual characters under the guidance of a human coach.
  %% The user only needs to provide a primitive initial controller and high-level, 
  %% human-readable instructions as if coaching a human trainee.

  %% %% We introduce the ``motor tree'' as a new representation of motor skills
  %% %% to provide a direct mapping between high-level instructions and

  %% To facilitate the mapping between high-level instructions and
  %% control variables, we introduce a new representation of motor skills,
  %% the ``motor tree'' which hierarchically organizes the skills from the low-level
  %% motions to the complex ones.
  %% The hierarchical structure enables flexible re-assembly and 
  %% efficient re-optimization by preserving the invariant features
  %% of motor skills.
  %% Further, the optimization process is accelerated by several techniques
  %% such as utilizing the failed previous trials or 
  %% exploiting the idling time of optimizer.
  %% With the propose framework, the human coach can design complex dynamic controller
  %% for virtual characters intuitively and interactively.
