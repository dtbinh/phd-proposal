%% Human-in-the-loop

We propose a human-in-the-loop (HITL) system to develop dynamic
controllers for virtual characters under the guidance of a human coach.
The user only needs to provide a primitive initial controller and high-level, 
human-readable instructions as if coaching a human trainee.
The virtual character interprets the provided instructions,
accumulate the knowledge from the human coach,
and iteratively improves its motor skills by optimizing control parameters.
%% We introduce the ``motor tree'' as a new representation of motor skills
%% to provide a direct mapping between high-level instructions and
%% low-level control variables.
To facilitate the mapping between high-level instructions and
control variables, we introduce a new representation of motor skills,
the ``motor tree'' which hierarchically organizes the skills from the low-level
motions to the complex ones.
The hierarchical structure enables flexible re-assembly and 
efficient re-optimization by preserving the invariant features
of motor skills.
Further, the optimization process is accelerated by several techniques
such as utilizing the failed previous trials or 
exploiting the idling time of optimizer.
With the propose framework, the human coach can design complex dynamic controller
for virtual characters intuitively and interactively.
