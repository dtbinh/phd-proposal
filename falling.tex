\chapter{Optimization of \protect\\ Falling and Landing Motions}

This section descries algorithm for generating natural and safe
falling and landing motions of virtual and real humanoids.
First, we develop an online controller that 
allows the virtual character to fall from a wide range of heights
and initial speeds, continuously roll on the ground, and get back
on its feet, without inducing large stress on joints at any moment.
For a real robot, we investigate a scenario of safe falling 
strategy for large external perturbations, which rapidly
plans a sequence of contacts to reduce the maximum impact.
